The BMI calculator program is a user-interactive Python script that helps individuals determine their Body Mass Index using their weight and height inputs. By applying a simple mathematical formula, it computes the BMI and classifies the result into health-related categories such as Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese. The program demonstrates clear function-based design and encourages good coding practices through separation of logic. It is an excellent example of how programming can be used in real-life health-related applications to promote awareness about fitness and body health.
